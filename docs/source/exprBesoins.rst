The Vanir project is a web site about history. Many web site, books, or in school talk about history with dates or Events to learn par coeur. For exemples : 1515 marignan, Henry IV was murdered by Ravaillac, Charlemagne was crawn Imperator in 800, Constantinople was destroyed in 1453, July, 14th 1789 the take of the bastille, etc. But is it the right way to learn history. What is the interest to learn history ? Is it only to learn dates and old events which has nothing to do with the life of everydays

Exemple : 1515, the battle of Marignan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

if you ask to every french poeple : " What happened in 1515 ?" Or just "1515 ?". You will certainly have the answer : "Marignan". If you ask for more precise informations, you may have a these answers : "François 1st", "Winning battle", "Italia" and may be "The Renaissance". But is it the rignt informations to remember about this events ? Do, the french poeple know the answer of these questions ?

- "Why François 1st attack Milan ?"
- "Was it a great battle" ?
- "What are the consqueances of this battle for Milan ? For the France ? For François 1st himself ?"

Marignan is one of the battle of a war call the Great Italian Wars. François 1st is a young king who just take the power. François 1st need to etablish his power and à Winning battle will be a good deal for him. The battle is one of the first battle where the artillery was used in a large part. The battle during two days wich was not common. About 15,000 soldiers died in this battle which was also not common for the epoch. François 1st win this battle but just close. But he return
in france with the story of à Great Winning Battle. The propaganda was very strong. The story is written by the winners". 
Marignan is à very interesting battle which had some unique facts due to the Rennaissance new technolosie. This is a battle due to many fact, the Great italien war, a new crowned king etc.
The consequences for italia, France, arts, François 1st are also very interestings. But even if all french poeple know this battle with this date, All interestings facts about this battle are often ignored. 
History is a science which can be used to learn more about the "Human Nature". With History we can more understand actual events. 
The objective of the Vanir project is to showcase causes and consequences about history events and not about dates. In our Opinion, one of the key to better understand or world is to talk about causes and consequences.
